        <p><strong><em>Independence:</em></strong> Eagles are solitary birds, and they are known for their ability to
            hunt and survive alone. Similarly, the saying suggests that strong individuals don't rely on the presence or
            support of others to achieve their goals. They are self-sufficient and self-reliant.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Strength:</em></strong> Eagles are powerful creatures, capable of flying at great heights and speeds. Metaphorically, this saying implies that strong individuals possess inner strength, resilience, and determination. They can overcome challenges and obstacles on their own.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Leadership:</em></strong> Eagles are often seen as symbols of leadership and authority. They are at the top of the avian food chain and are respected by other birds. In the same way, the saying conveys the idea that leaders often stand alone in their decisions and actions. They make tough choices and lead by example, even if it means standing apart from the crowd.</p>
